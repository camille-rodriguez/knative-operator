description: |
  Kubernetes-based platform to deploy and manage modern serverless workloads
summary: |
  Knative components build on top of Kubernetes, abstracting away the complex details and enabling developers to focus on what matters. Built by codifying the best practices shared by successful real-world implementations, Knative solves the "boring but difficult" parts of deploying and managing cloud native services so you don't have to.

  Knative has two components: Serving and Eventing. This charm deploys the controller core of the Serving component.
